<p> As soon as the sun peaked over the horizon, Max knew that it was going to be a great day for playing baseball. Max's dad had promised him that they would play a game sometime this week, and today was the day. Max jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed. When he arrived in the backyard where his dad was already waiting, he could hear the sound of the ball hitting the glove. Max felt his excitement growing with every step he took toward the field. He could already smell the freshly-cut grass and hear the wind blowing through the trees. "Are you ready, Max?" his dad asked with a grin. Max nodded eagerly, and his dad tossed him the ball. Max caught it with ease and threw it back, feeling the satisfying smack of the ball hitting his dad's glove. They spent the morning playing catch and running the bases. Max's dad gave him some tips on catching and throwing, and Max listened intently, hanging onto every word. As the sun climbed higher in the sky, Max's dad suggested that they play a full game. Max eagerly agreed, and they each grabbed a bat. Max's dad tossed the ball, and Max swung with all his might. The ball sailed straight down the middle, and Max ran as fast as he could around the bases. He felt an adrenaline rush as he slid into home, feeling the dirt and grass slide under his cleats. Max's dad was a tough pitcher, and he quickly struck Max out on the next at-bat. But Max wasn't going to let that defeat him. He cheered on his dad as he played, and they both laughed and joked between innings. By the end of the game, Max was exhausted but exhilarated. They had played a tight game, but Max's dad had emerged victorious in the end. Max didn't mind, though. He was just happy to have spent such a fantastic day playing baseball with his dad. As they walked back to the house, Max knew that it was a day that he would never forget.</p>
